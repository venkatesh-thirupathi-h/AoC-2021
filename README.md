My solution for [AoC 2021](ventofcode.com/2021/) written primarily
in C
I tried to do use separate language for each problem,
I can't handle the pressure of learning two languages a day,
but even they're similar, it takes a significant amount of time to learn,
thus I have less time to solving the actual problem.

I tried this because I was inspired by rexim, but I will do it next year.
Inspired by [Tsoding](https://github.com/tsoding)'s(rexim) approach in 2020's [AoC](https://github.com/tsoding/aoc-2020).

Each day directory would contain
1. source code is in a single file for each problem if it's done in 
    different languages, otherwise in a single file.
2. sample input and full input data
3. Simple Makefile for building.

going to finish the rest of the problem from today because it's November so I am one month away from AOC 2022.
